## 4. Architecture recommendations

The following architectural recommendations can be made.

### **4.1 Batch processing & gas usage**

The batch processing methods (`_burnBatch`, `_mintBatch`) should be monitored for gas consumption, especially when handling a large array of delegates. The same applies for deploying multiple proxy contracts, when dealing with a wide array of new delegates as targets.

This is especially relevant if an implementation intends to handle gas for users (i.e. meta transactions), which could easily be abused, even by accident.

### **4.2 User interface**

This application requires a thoroughly designed interface. Otherwise, it would be too easy to mess up the array formatting, thereby performing unintended transactions.

While in most cases it would not constitute a significant risk, it _could_ in some edge cases. For instance, in the event of a highly disputed vote, any widespread malfunction in the system could have drastic consequences.
