## 7. Conclusion

During this audit, which was my first, I first felt a bit disappointed not finding medium/high issues. But, it's actually a testament to the developer's expertise.

Systems implementing new approaches, to address a missing or unusual solution, often thrive when simplified strategically. This specific code might appear complex at first glance, however it's actually rather straightforward, with clever layout beneath the surface.

Depending on the final results, this audit will provide a good reflection of my current skills. Regardless of financial outcomes, I really enjoyed the process; it was great auditing a system I'm truly interested in, while improving my testing skills, with in-depth analysis and formal verification methods.

Looking forward, Iâ€™m eager to dive into more implementations from the ENS team and help with the review and security assessment.
