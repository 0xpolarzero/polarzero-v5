## 5. Centralization risks

The only privilege of the owner is the ability to change the `ERC1155` metadata URI (`setUri`), which **does not directly affect the core functionality** of the `ERC20MultiDelegate` contract. Its operations, like delegation, proxy deployment, and transfers, would be left unaffected by any update of this URI.

The only issue would be an inconvenience for the users, due to the **inaccessibility/tempering of information** related to a delegate. Which definitely does **not** constitute a significant centralization risk.
