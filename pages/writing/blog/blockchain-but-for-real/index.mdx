## Overview

I needed to share some explanations about blockchain. I’ve been working in this industry for two years now, and usually this implies being extremely emphatic about this technology, which I’m not enough — it’s time to rectify.

Loosely, I will attempt to summarize the following points:

1.  **What is the current perception of blockchain? Why such a tarnished reputation?**

2.  **What is it actually, and what does it enable?**

3.  **How does this technology work (broadly)?**

4.  **What does it imply for the near future?**

5.  **How can we find our place, and why is it important to at least start learning now?**
