## 1. The Power of Words: “Security Reviews” vs. “Security Audits”

Before we dive into the technicalities, we should address a significant semantic issue: the terminology we use to describe the process of reviewing/auditing the security aspects of a smart contract. While the term “audits” has long been the industry norm, there is a growing movement advocating for the use of “reviews” as a more accurate and adequate description of the process.

### Why “Security Reviews” Resonate Better

The term “audit” conjures representations of a checklist-driven process, which would be centered on compliance and conventional methods. It’s a word inherited from traditional industries, where the primary purpose is to verify that existing systems satisfy predetermined standards; which fails to accurately communicate the dynamic and nuanced nature of smart contract security.

On the other hand, “security review” suggests a more comprehensive, research-oriented process. Which implies looking for innovative attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities that typical checklists may ignore or overlook. This word is more closely aligned with the investigative nature of smart contract evaluation, which frequently involves pushing the boundaries of what’s considered “secure” to uncover hidden risks.

### The Cultural Shift

The adjustment from “audits” to “reviews” is not just a semantic issue; it’s a cultural change. As the field of smart contract security continues to evolve, the roles we assume will also undergo diversification. We’re not just “auditors” ticking off boxes; we’re “security researchers” engaged in a rigorous intellectual quest to fortify the decentralized ecosystem. In the fast-paced smart contracts landscape, such an evolution indicates a more mature appreciation of what is required to secure complex, dynamic systems.
