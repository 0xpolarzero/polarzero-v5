## 4. Closing thoughts

I often approach big companies and institutions with a hint of skepticism, especially when they grow into major entities.

However, my reservations are tempered when their track record is only made of actual, security-focused products with real and practical use cases, consistently over the years.

It’s one thing to appreciate a company’s intentions, but here, speculation takes a backseat to tangible, positive outcomes that Chainlink consistently delivers to this space.
