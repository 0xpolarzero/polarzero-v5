## 2. The backbone of Web3

Again, Chainlink’s intention is clear: to not merely release products, but to shape industry standards.

As developers, it’s crucial to consider the security and integrity of the systems we build. Chainlink’s suite of products provides a comprehensive solution — framework — to address many of the vulnerabilities inherent in decentralized applications. This is demonstrated in their approach to integrating external data sources, automating logic-based tasks, facilitating cross-chain interactions, and now streamlining contract-based interactions, ensuring low-latency data delivery and automated trade execution. _(pause)_

These tools not only help in ensuring that blockchain is ready, robust, and applicable **in the real world**, but also provide a much-needed consistency across projects, which is the essence of a framework.

On a side note, it’s also essential, as always, to keep a balanced view. While Chainlink provides solutions to many challenges, it’s crucial to understand that it still requires careful implementation and continuous monitoring to ensure the utmost security and efficiency. Using Chainlink does **not** **necessarily** mean that it is **safely and efficiently implemented**.
