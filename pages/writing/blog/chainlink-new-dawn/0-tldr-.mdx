## 0. TLDR;

Allow me to provide you with an early summary of what you should understand from this post, if you don’t have the time, or don’t feel like reading it.

Chainlink is **not** _pushing_ for mass adoption, and they are **not** trying to _onboard_ users. They are **not** working to deliver short-term value or aggressively incentivize people to use their services in the promise of an airdrop. They are **not** building a new infrastructure, a new blockchain, not even a new system.

This is kind of unusual in this industry, as we’re used to projects spanning during the night, raising absurd amounts of money, and employing all the points mentioned above; all of this in the span of a few months.

What Chainlink **does**, essentially, is leveraging blockchain to improve technology that already exists; I mean, **in the real world**. They are delivering and iterating over actual products, meant to be used by financial institutions from both worlds, and integrated with their _existing_ infrastructure. This is not only convenient, but also necessary, as we can’t expect each one of them to (re)deploy their entire system on a new blockchain, whenever they want to integrate with a product.

Fundamentally, they are gradually establishing a secure framework for integrating with crypto assets — from a traditional perspective. One that can be trusted, reused, and standardized.

Interestingly, they are _actually_ driving mass adoption, just by consistently delivering tangible value, thus maturing the industry and technology one release at a time.

On a side note, [The Developer Hub](https://dev.chain.link/) is the epitome of precision, clarity, and comprehensive information; Chainlink sets the highest standards of quality in every detail, and the documentation/education is no exception to it.
