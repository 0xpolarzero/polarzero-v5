### Polygon ID: Managing decentralized identities

_A platform for managing decentralized identities using ZKPs._

> Polygon ID infrastructure makes use of an off-chain decentralized identity model called [Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)](https://www.dock.io/post/self-sovereign-identity) that **enables identity providers like banks or governments to issue credentials such as university degrees or driving licenses**. Users store these credentials in privately-held wallets and maintain control over them, opting to submit them to apps and services.

>
> With Polygon ID, **users can opt to submit these credentials to smart contracts and interact with on-chain dApps** _[Note: decentralized applications, usually interacting with blockchain infrastructure]_. Polygon has made this transition from off to on-chain possible through the magic of zero-knowledge proofs which not only **attest to the existence of the credential, but do so in a way that keeps user privacy at its zenith**. _ZKPs_ do not reveal specific details about users, they **only confirm, or ‘prove’ that a statement about a user is true**. For instance, **they could confirm that a user is over eighteen without stating their exact age**.

### Vocdoni: Pioneering anonymous digital voting

_A decentralized digital voting system (Voĉdoni: “to give voice” in Esperanto)._

> Anyone can create an anonymous voting process that will allow users to vote with the **cryptographic assurance that nobody can correlate their identity with the contents of their ballot**. […] Users can still trace their own ballots from the time of voting to the calculation of results, and they can **inspect the contents of their vote envelope as it is counted**.

Additionally, an excerpt that perfectly reflects the essence of this piece:

> It’s important to notice that when we talk about voting we are not referring to a digital version of nation-state like elections. This is only a potential instance, and it implies a wide range of connotations that we not necessarily share.
>
> ”We refer to voting as a much more generic and low-level system. As a collective signaling mechanism that gives cryptographic guarantees about its integrity and its outcome.”
>

Finally, a blog post on how Bellpuig Mayor Jordi Estiarte (Spain) used Vocdoni to conduct a public consultation, as part of his promise to “increase direct citizen participation”:

And now that this article has brought us all the way from merely philosophical observations to this tangible demonstration of participative democracy, I feel that it’s only natural to conclude our journey here.
