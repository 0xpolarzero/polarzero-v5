## 2. The flaws of traditional governance

### Pitfalls of established hierarchies

Traditional hierarchical systems, from educational institutions to political organizations, have long incentivized people to delegate their power — choices — to _chosen_ delegates.

This process usually takes the form of an _election_, which by definition is a _choice_ exercised through a vote. As this action is actively presented as **participating** in governance, it often **inflates the actual impact of this systematized process**. You get to pick a delegate during a ceremonious institutional event, based on a commitment, that you can only hope will be honored during the following years/months.

**The influence of people’s choices, and by extension their lives, fluctuates dramatically — occasionally being exceedingly significant, but in between, diminishing to almost negligible.**

Additionally, constantly delegating our _choices_ means far too frequently **delegating our _knowledge and understanding_** as well. Which consequently emphasizes the belief that most people are “not educated enough” to perform decisions. Which incentivize them to delegate to these _better informed_ ones. You get the point.

True participation seems more than just electing representatives, but about taking direct responsibility, compelling us to inform ourselves and make mature decisions. However, our established systems often discourage such active engagement.

### An illusion of rational compromise in democracy

One way of approaching large-scale decisions is to consider them — [to borrow words from Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html) — as either _concave_ or _convex_. This applies more extensively to any tradeoff between compromise and purity.

I believe a significant part of **modern democracies is designed with a concave disposition**. This could be roughly illustrated as follows, assuming that the options are interchangeable; this is not the point here. This conception will be later discussed and iteratively refined.

The way we delegate through elections would be (very) roughly considered somewhere between anarchism and dictatorship. Arguably, this is precisely where democracy lies. However, there’s more: governance directly by the population is just as much democracy as it is through representatives — consider [participatory democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy) as an example.

### Delegation’s drawbacks and power struggles

Nevertheless, a significant flaw in the current system is the concentration of decision-making power. Even if it _could_ always be more centralized, most representatives carry heavy responsibilities. Which results in virtually the **same symptoms** as their absence, i.e. **growing indifference** — in this case rather due to **a decreasing sense of connection with the actual people these delegates represent**.

This detachment is not just inefficient; it poses tangible dangers. Decisions made without fully understanding ground realities can — and will — have adverse, widespread impacts.

As a matter of fact, everyone has some kind of purpose, whether it’s personal, collective or, more often than not, both. Representatives are no exception, and by being unable to maintain contact with those around them, they eventually come to rely decreasingly on empathy. **At this point, the cherished concept of common good will inevitably be reduced to a merely abstract idea and lose all its essence** — an essence that yet provides a **safeguard against occasionally misplaced ambition**.

This brings us to corruption, which at this stage becomes a conceivable option.
