A great way to get tailored explanations is to ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (or any AI adapted to chat) “Explain _x_ like I’m _y_”, where “x” is a concept and “y” an age. For instance, “Explain blockchain like I’m 10”.

**a. Blockchain**

  > You (a “**node**”) have a file of transactions on your computer (a **“ledger”**). Two government accountants (let’s call them **“miners”**) have the **same file **on theirs (so it’s **“distributed”**). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.
  >
  > Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary **“Bitcoins”**). The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction (**“proof of work”**). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file…
  >
  > This concept is enabled by **“Blockchain” **technology.
