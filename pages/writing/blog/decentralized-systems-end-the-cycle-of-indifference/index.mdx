## Overview

> _This article intentionally neglects the actual functioning of blockchain and decentralized system (as in allowing for truly fair, transparent and censorship-resistant democratic governance). It is built upon the acknowledgement of these abilities, mostly due to the way smart contracts work, to try to address higher-level political/philosophical involvements. Additionally, it abstracts from the assumption that everyone has access to electricity, internet, and devices — prerequisites not at all universally available. Some educational resources are provided in the references section, if you need/would like to understand it at a lower level._

Our traditional systems, from education to politics, have long promoted **a culture of delegation**. From the early days in schools where we elect student delegates, to later in life where we’re conditioned to elect officials — presidents, senators, and other leaders — **to make decisions on our behalf**.

British writer Graham Greene observed that indifference is _“the perfection of egoism”_. This prevalent delegation might indirectly foster and reinforce such societal indifference and sense of detachment.

This post is an attempt to shed light on the potential of [decentralized systems](https://konghq.com/blog/engineering/web3-basics-what-is-decentralization) in reshaping societal norms and challenging the _status quo_ of delegation.
