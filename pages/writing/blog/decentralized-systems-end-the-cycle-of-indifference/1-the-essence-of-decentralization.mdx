## 1. The essence of decentralization

I believe that [blockchain](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/strategy-operations/articles/blockchain-explained.html) and decentralized systems directly address the concern of indifference, as they contribute to **reshaping both systemic and societal structures**.

This aspect isnâ€™t always highlighted, as there are more immediate and easily observable consequences that tend to overshadow it. This one, however, is a natural consequence of [distributed ledger technologies](https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/what-are-distributed-ledger-technologies-dlts), which encompass distributed systems like [peer-to-peer networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-p2p-peer-to-peer-process/), decentralized governance models, and various consensus mechanisms.

Ultimately, this shift appears to perfectly reflect the **_ethos_** and culture associated with these kinds of systems.
