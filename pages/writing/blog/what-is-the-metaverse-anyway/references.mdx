This space attracted about 7 million users between November 2021 and March 2022. [Sutcliffe, C. (2022, March 22). _Nearly 7 million people have visited Nike's metaverse store.

// Since the end of 2021, Adidas has been building relationships with leading brands in the NFT scene (e.g., by purchasing a BAYC, whose value exceeded 100 ETH at the end of January 2022, which at that time corresponded to approximately $260,000). The brand is gradually strengthening its presence in the metaverse with virtual collections, avatars, and offers to "enter the metaverse." [Adidas. Section "metaverse".](https://www.adidas.fr/metaverse)
// These brands are far from being the only ones, most of them manage to link part of their market to the metaverse, or even thoroughly change their communication on social networks to integrate into it (Puma, Dolce & Gabana, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton...; Hello Kitty, which has a space in the Roblox editor, and which counts 47.6 million visits in a little less than a month, between April 4 and May 9, 2022.)

// > ”The common conception of the metaverse is long into the future, where interoperable worlds can connect together and will open new doors when it comes to economics, social interactions, and experiences. At most, we have various micro-metaverses where people play in private worlds (such as Fortnite); but it's a stretch to say we are already in the metaverse.” ; “While gaming will certainly be part of the metaverse, it further confused the data to the gaming side, when it will be so much bigger.” </span> [↩](#7)

// 8. <span id="ft8"> Among all the companies that claim to build a metaverse, Yuga Labs, which has some of the most popular NFT collections (BAYC, CryptoPunks, Meebits), launched a collection of terrains usable in their future metaverse (Otherside) in April 2022. They raised on this collection almost $600 million in 24 hours, in addition to the support of a large Venture Capitalist, Andreessen Horowitz, which led a campaign that brought them $450 million in March 2022. The creators explain, about their platform, that it will be :
// > "[...] a gamified, interoperable metaverse [...] The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) and web3-enabled virtual worlds. Think of it as a metaRPG where the players own the world, your NFTs can become playable characters, and thousands can play together in real time.” </span> [↩](#8)
