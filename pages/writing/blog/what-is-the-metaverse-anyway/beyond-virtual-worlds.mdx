## Beyond virtual worlds

### So, what _is_ a metaverse, then?

In this case, it is necessary to borrow elements of definition from the concept of _virtual world_, which is very close to the definition of metaverse. In fact, it can be established that a metaverse _is_ a virtual world. This last term is defined by the following:

> Virtual worlds are persistent online computer-generated environments where multiple users in remote physical locations can interact in real time for the purposes of work or play. Virtual worlds constitute a subset of virtual reality applications, a more general term that refers to computer-generated simulations of three-dimensional objects or environments with seemingly real, direct, or physical user interaction.<sup>**(4)**</sup>

Does it sound familiar?

This definition fits quite well to spaces that claim to be metaverses (The Sandbox, Decentraland, Roblox in some way, Cryptovoxels...). In addition, the characteristics established at the beginning (interaction with the blockchain, virtual identity and avatar) can ensure a safer classification. Recent applications of this concept systematically integrate NFTs and cryptocurrencies as a determining part of the environment. In reality, it is more cautious to identify a virtual space as a metaverse according to these criteria, but the classification is increasingly tolerant.

### Don't they look more like video games?

They do! And I would say they are in some ways.

Indeed, the distinction between video game and metaverse is always narrower, and some video games can be considered as metaverses, and vice versa. A video game is defined as _"an electronic game with a user interface that involves interaction to generate visual feedback"_ allowing a user (or several) _"to have an impact on the game and to perceive the consequences of their actions on a virtual environment"_ <sup>**(5)**</sup>. This definition presents characteristics that can be found in most metaverses. Conversely, some video games, especially MMORPGs, have the same characteristics as the virtual worlds we defined earlier. They require a considerable involvement from the players, encourage interaction within communities, facilitate the incorporation between the player and their avatar or virtual identity, have a vast and persistent environment that evolves according to the players' actions... Actually, these video games can be considered as metaverses. Most of them would be, for many users, their first experience of a social network on a global scale: in some spaces, players discuss and exchange constantly, but also within guilds, channels dedicated to trade, to battle... Such an extension of reality allows Internet users to meet again virtually, in a persistent universe, with particular rules, mixing various communities while bypassing geographic boundaries.
